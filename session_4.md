# Docker Registry
<br>


## Prerequisite

- Good to have have two machines. We can either use two VMs or two instances from a cloud provider (AWS) in same VLAN. This set up would be more suitable to run through the lab. 
- Log into the two instances and ensure that Docker is installed. 
- Execute **docker info** command to ensure that the user has required permissions. 
- If there is an error, we can switch to **sudo** user and continue.
With that set, congratulations! We have successfully setup our lab.
<br>


## Lab 1 - Running the first Registry Server

In this lab session we will run our very first Registry Server based on the **registry:2.7** image available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/registry).

### Spin-up the Registry Server

- Log into the first Docker host.
- Make a note of IP address of this host. We can get the IP, using **ifconfig** command.
- Execute following command
```
docker run -it -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2.7
```

### Interacting with the Registry Server

- Open a browser and go to **http://REGISTRY-HOST-IP:5000/v2/_catalog/**
- This returns the list of **Repositories** as a JSON response, and it should look like
```
// http://REGISTRY-HOST-IP:5000/v2/_catalog
{
  "repositories": [
  ]
}
```
<br>


## Lab 2 - Push a Docker Image to Registry 

In this lab session we will build a Docker image and then push it to the Registry.

### Build a Docker Image

- Create a Dockerfile using the **nano Dockerfile**
- Add the following commands in the Dockerfile
```
FROM busybox
LABEL Author="<YOUR-NAME>"
LABEL Event="DockerPune Meetup"
```
- Execute the following command to build the image 
```
docker build -t <REGISTRY-HOST-IP>:5000/my-busybox .
```
- Execute **docker images** to verify the image 

### Push the image

- Execute the following command to tag the image
```
docker tag <REGISTRY-HOST-IP>:5000/my-busybox <REGISTRY-HOST-IP>:5000/my-busybox:v1
docker tag <REGISTRY-HOST-IP>:5000/my-busybox <REGISTRY-HOST-IP>:5000/my-busybox:custom
```
- Execute the command to push the image
```
docker push <REGISTRY-HOST-IP>:5000/my-busybox
```

### Verify the push

- Open a browser and go to **http://REGISTRY-HOST-IP:5000/v2/_catalog/**
- This returns the list of **Repositories** as a JSON response, and it should look like
```
// http://FIRST-HOST-IP:5000/v2/_catalog
{
  "repositories": [
    "my-busybox"
  ]
}
```
- Go to **http://REGISTRY-HOST-IP:5000/v2/my-busybox/tags/list/** to get list of image tags
```
// http://FIRST-HOST-IP:5000/v2/my-busybox/tags/list
{
  "name": "my-busybox",
  "tags": [
    "custom"
    "latest",
    "v1"
  ]
}
```

## Lab 3 - Pulling the image

In this lab session we will learn how to add our registry to different Docker hosts and pull an image.

### The First Attempt

- Go to second Docker host
- Execute the following command to pull the image we just pushed to our registry
```
docker pull <REGISTRY-HOST-IP>:5000/my-busybox

Using default tag: latest
Error response from daemon: Get https://13.233.122.144:5000/v2/: http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client
```
- What's wrong? 
- Execute **docker info** command to get Docker daemon details and notice **Insecure Registries**.
  
### Add the Registry Server

- Execute the following command to create the config file for Docker **daemon**
```
nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
```
- Add the following JSON
```
{
  "insecure-registries" : ["REGISTRY-HOST-IP:5000"]
}
```
- Restart the Docker daemon by executing the command **sudo service docker restart**
- Retry to pull the image
```
docker pull <REGISTRY-HOST-IP>:5000/my-busybox
```
<br>


## Lab 4 - Preserving the Registry Data

In this lab session, we will learn about preserving the registry data even after the server is stopped. 

### Stop the Registry server

- Stop and remove the registry server using the following commands
```
docker container stop registry
docker container rm registry
```
- Restart the registry server using the following command
```
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2.7
```
- Go to **http://REGISTRY-HOST-IP:5000/v2/_catalog/** and observe that we have lost the repositories

### Preserving data with Volumes

- Stop and remove the registry server with above commands
- Restart the registry server and add a volume with the following command
```
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -v registry-data:/var/lib/registry --name registry registry:2.7
```
- Push the image again with the above used commands

### Testing 

- Stop and remove the registry server with above commands
- Execute the command **docker volume ls** to check if volume is not deleted
- Restart the registry server and add the same volume with the following command
```
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -v registry-data:/var/lib/registry --name registry registry:2.7
```
- Go to **http://REGISTRY-HOST-IP:5000/v2/_catalog/** and observe that our repositories are still there.

## Lab 5 - Securing our Registry with Basic Auth

In this lab session we will learn about how we can secure our registry using basic authentication.

### Build new Registry Image

- Stop and remove the registry server with above commands
- Creata a new Dockerfile with **nano Dockerfile** command and the following commands to it:
```
FROM registry:2.7

# store the username and password in /auth/htpasswd file
RUN mkdir /auth && htpasswd -bnB admin admin > /auth/htpasswd

# set the environment variables for registry
ENV REGISTRY_AUTH htpasswd
ENV REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM basic-realm
ENV REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH /auth/htpasswd

# expose port for registry
EXPOSE 5000
```
- Build an image using the following command
```
docker build -t secure-registry .
```
- Start the registry server with new image, using the following command
```
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -v registry-data:/var/lib/registry --name registry secure-registry
```
- Go to **http://REGISTRY-HOST-IP:5000/v2/_catalog/** and observe that now we are prompted for username and password.

### Push an Image

- Let's try to push the image we had built earlier, and this time we will fail
```
docker push localhost:5000/my-busybox

The push refers to repository [localhost:5000/my-busybox]
adab5d09ba79: Preparing 
no basic auth credentials
```
- Login to the registry using the following command, and provide username and password as prompted
```
docker login localhost:5000
```
- Retry to push the image now

### Pull an Image

- Let's try to pull an image on second host, and we will fail here as well
- Login to the registry using the following command, and provide username and password as prompted
```
docker login localhost:5000
```
- Retry to pull the image now

## Lab 6 - Adding a User Interface 

In this lab session we will learn about how we can set a clean user interface for our Registry.

- Run the following command to add a frontend to registry
```
docker run \
  -d \
  -e ENV_DOCKER_REGISTRY_HOST=YOUR-REGISTRY-HOST \
  -e ENV_DOCKER_REGISTRY_PORT=5000 \
  -p 8080:80 \
  konradkleine/docker-registry-frontend:v2
```
- Open a browser and go to **http://REGISTRY-HOST-IP:8080/**
- Provide login username and password for the registry
